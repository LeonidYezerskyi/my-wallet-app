This project is a simple web application that allows the user to connect his crypto wallet, check his account balance and wallet address, and perform a token transfer from the connected wallet to another address on the Ethereum Goerli network.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ethers, prop-types, react-router-dom, react-toastify, gitHub, and vite.js.
